**Introduction:**

The purpose of this vision document is to outline the goals, objectives,
and key elements of the project to develop a website that enables users
to scan pictures from hard copy books and view them as interactive 3D
models. The website will utilize augmented reality technology to enhance
the users\' understanding of diagrams and provide a unique learning
experience. The project aims to leverage the power of Unity for the
seamless integration of 3D models onto the scanned images.

**Background (Survey):**

Extensive research and analysis have been conducted to identify the need
for an innovative solution that bridges the gap between traditional hard
copy books and interactive digital content. Surveys and studies have
highlighted the growing demand for immersive learning experiences and
the potential benefits of utilizing augmented reality in education. By
addressing this need, our project will revolutionize the way users
interact with educational materials.

**Objectives and Targets (with Gap Analysis):**

**Objectives:**

-   Develop a user-friendly website that allows users to scan pictures
    from hard copy books.

-   Implement augmented reality technology to overlay interactive 3D
    models onto the scanned images.

-   Enhance users\' understanding of complex diagrams and illustrations
    through interactive visualization.

-   Provide a seamless and intuitive user experience for navigating
    through scanned books and interacting with 3D models.

-   Support a wide range of devices, including desktops, laptops, and
    mobile devices, to ensure accessibility.

**Gap Analysis:**

-   Limited availability of user-friendly platforms for scanning
    pictures from hard copy books and transforming them into interactive
    3D models.

-   Insufficient integration of augmented reality technology with
    educational content, particularly in the context of printed
    materials.

-   Lack of intuitive user interfaces and navigation systems that
    facilitate a seamless experience for users.

**Milestones:**

-   Milestone 1: Project Planning and Requirements Gathering (2 weeks)

-   Milestone 2: Website Design and Interface Development (4 weeks)

-   Milestone 3: Integration of Scanning Functionality and Image
    Processing (6 weeks)

-   Milestone 4: Augmented Reality Implementation using Unity (8 weeks)

-   Milestone 5: User Testing and Bug Fixing (2 weeks)

-   Milestone 6: Deployment and Launch of the Website (2 weeks)

By creating this vision document, we aim to provide a comprehensive
overview of the project, including its objectives, target audience, and
implementation strategy. This document will serve as a guiding framework
for the development team throughout the project lifecycle, ensuring a
focused and successful execution of the augmented reality book scanning
website.
